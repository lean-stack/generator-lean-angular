# generator-lean-angular [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> A generator to create lean angular projects.

This generator was made for mainly personal use in my trainings and workshops.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-lean-angular using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-lean-angular
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo lean-angular
```

## Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He&#39;s a person with feelings and opinions, but he&#39;s very easy to work with. If you think he&#39;s too opinionated, he can be easily convinced. Feel free to [learn more about him](http://yeoman.io/).
